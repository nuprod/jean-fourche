* 2.1.6 (2026-06-23)
    - [IMP] Added a "Store Mappings" smart button on product field definitions, showing how many store-specific mappings use the definition and opening them in one click.
    - [FIX] Improved contact matching during order import to prevent duplicate contacts. A previously mapped contact that has no parent company is no longer reused when the order requires a company (B2B) context, and company assignment changes are now detected correctly — avoiding wrongly reused or duplicated contacts.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where e-commerce payments registered in a currency different from the order currency were recorded without conversion, resulting in an incorrect payment amount. The amount is now correctly converted from the external currency into the order currency.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where matching existing Odoo records by name during import used the current user's language instead of the integration's store language. In multi-language setups this could fail to find existing records (attributes, categories, delivery carriers, taxes, pricelists, order sub-statuses) and create duplicates. Matching now consistently uses the integration language.
    - [FIX] Other improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 2.1.4 (2026-05-27)
    - [IMP] Added "Auto-Link" button for attribute values, allowing users to quickly map external attribute values to existing Odoo attribute values — particularly useful when working with custom attribute mappings.
    - [IMP] Improved VIES VAT validation handling when the service is temporarily unavailable or overloaded. The connector now automatically retries the request up to 3 times before proceeding — and if the service remains unavailable, the order is imported successfully with a note added to the contact's chatter to flag the unvalidated VAT number.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where product export used incorrect company context in multi-company setups. When a product was shared between multiple companies, the connector could export data (such as taxes and cost price) from the wrong company instead of the one associated with the integration, resulting in incorrect values being sent to the e-commerce store.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where external records created during product export were assigned the name "False" instead of the actual product name from the e-commerce store. This occurred when the connector detected an existing matching product and switched to import mode — the product name is now correctly retrieved and stored on the external record.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where product webhooks did not respect the product import filters configured in the integration settings (e.g. "import active products only"). Products received via webhooks are now validated against the same filters as the regular import process, preventing unwanted products from being created in Odoo.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where product export failed with a "Duplicate internal reference" error in multi-company setups when two companies had products with the same SKU. The connector now correctly scopes the duplicate SKU check to the integration's company, allowing products with identical SKUs across different companies to be exported without conflict.
    - [FIX] Other improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 2.1.3 (2026-04-08)
    - [IMP] The Transaction Date imported from the e-commerce store is now used as the Payment Date when creating payments in Odoo, ensuring payment records accurately reflect the original transaction date rather than the date of import.
    - [IMP] The "Allow Multi-Company Inventory Calculation" setting has been removed. Multi-company stock calculation per location is now always enabled automatically with the correct company context applied, simplifying configuration.
    - [IMP] API credentials (access tokens, secret keys, passwords) are now masked in connector authentication wizards, preventing sensitive information from being accidentally exposed.
    - [IMP] When using the "Auto-Link" button on a product mapping, the result is now displayed in a dialog instead of silently failing or showing a raw error message.
    - [IMP] Multiple small UI/UX improvements across connector views to enhance usability and overall user experience.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where product variants remained archived in Odoo after the product was unarchived via webhook, causing the product to appear active while its variants were still inactive.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where inventory export in multi-company setups could ignore configured stock locations belonging to a different company than the one set on the store connection, causing incorrect stock quantities to be sent to the e-commerce store.
    - [FIX] Fixed a critical issue where preprocessing scripts in "Order and Delivery Attribute Import Mapping" silently failed on Odoo 19.0, returning empty values instead of the computed result. The failure was caused by an incompatible argument in the script execution engine and was not visible to the user — only a hidden warning log was generated. All attribute import mappings that use preprocessing scripts are now working correctly.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where custom field mappings were incorrectly marked as system fields after migrating from version 1.X.X to 2.X.X.
    - [FIX] Other improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 2.1.2 (2026-03-20)
    - [NEW] Added detailed contact handling trace logs during order import to help diagnose how customers, delivery addresses, and invoice addresses are resolved. To enable, activate the "Save Logs" checkbox on the Testing tab and add "Customers Sync" to the Log Types. A "View Contact Trace" button on the external order form provides quick access to the saved trace for each imported order.
    - [NEW] Added support for "Create Advance Payments (Before Invoice)" — a new option in the Sales Orders tab (requires "Auto-Apply Payments from E-Commerce System" to be enabled). When active, the connector registers payments directly on the Sales Order at import time, before any invoice is created, using the OCA sale_advance_payment module. The auto-workflow payment step is fully compatible — it will skip payment creation if the advance payment already covers the invoice, or register only the remaining balance if partially covered.
    - [IMP] Added partial Spanish language translation for the connector interface (65% complete). We welcome community contributions to help translate the connector into other languages - if you'd like to help, please reach out to us at support@ventor.tech.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where customer matching during order import incorrectly fell back to name-based search when the configured search fields (e.g. email) had no value in the incoming order. This could cause orders without an email address to be incorrectly linked to an existing contact with the same name, leading to wrong order assignments and data privacy issues. The connector now respects the configured search fields strictly and creates a new contact instead of falling back to default matching criteria.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where real-time inventory synchronization was not triggered after completing a manufacturing order when "Forecasted Quantity" was selected as the Inventory Quantity Source Field, causing the produced product's stock level to remain outdated in the e-commerce store.
    - [FIX] Other improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 2.1.1 (2026-03-01)
    - [NEW] Added "Export Inventory Now" button to the Inventory tab, allowing users to manually trigger a full inventory export for all products at any time — regardless of the Scheduled Inventory Sync setting. The export runs in batches as background jobs, the same way the scheduled action does.
    - [NEW] Added "Run Now" button on background jobs (available in debug mode), allowing jobs to be executed in real time instead of being queued. This is primarily intended to simplify debugging and issue investigation.
    - [IMP] Added pre-defined filters "Mapped to Store(s)" and "Not Mapped to any Store" on the product list, making it easier to identify which products are synchronized with your e-commerce store and which still require mapping.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue where external records for newly created categories did not have the parent category set, causing inconsistency with imported categories where the parent was correctly assigned.
    - [FIX] Other improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 2.1.0 (2026-02-18)
    - [IMP] Enhanced UI/UX across connector views, based on customer feedback. The Status menu is now more functional, with quick access to unmapped records, store connections, and other key areas. The connections Kanban view was also improved, including a small 7-day orders chart and overall usability refinements to make daily monitoring and navigation more efficient.
    - [IMP] Improved initial product import batching logic. When importing products in batches, the connector now processes all valid products even if some items contain errors (e.g., missing or duplicated SKU). Problematic products are automatically grouped into a separate background job with a clear error message, allowing users to fix issues and requeue only the affected records - without blocking the entire batch.
    - [IMP] Improved multi-company product synchronization logic. The connector now validates the company on products during synchronization, ensuring that only products belonging to the integration’s company (or with no company set) are used. A new "Apply Company on Product" option was also added (disabled by default). When enabled, newly created products will automatically inherit the connection’s company, helping maintain clean and consistent multi-company data separation.
    - [FIX] Resolved an issue in the auto-workflow picking validation that could cause an infinite loop when button_validate() returned a wizard instead of completing the transfer. The connector now correctly stops auto-validation in such cases, preventing repeated background job execution while preserving normal validation behavior.
    - [FIX] Improved contact handling during order import. If a previously mapped Odoo contact is archived, the connector now ignores the existing mapping and creates a new active contact instead of assigning the archived one to the Sales Order.
    - [FIX] Improved translation handling on imported Sales Orders. Order lines now consistently use the customer’s language (not the Odoo UI language), including product names and discount line descriptions (e.g., "Discount for ..."). The connector also includes safe fallbacks when customer language or translations are missing.
    - [FIX] Other improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 2.0.0 (2026-01-23)
    - [BREAKING] This is a major release with backward-incompatible changes. Please review the `release notes <https://ecosystem.ventor.tech/faq/release-notes/>`__ before upgrading.
    - [IMP] Product field mapping engine fully refactored. The connector now supports flexible and extensible product field mappings, including custom Python-based transformation logic configurable directly from the Odoo UI.
    - [IMP] Improved handling of missing or custom order items. When an order line references a product that no longer exists or represents a custom item and a fallback product is used, the connector now preserves the original product name and SKU from the e-commerce order in the Sales Order Line description.
    - [IMP] Improved automatic cleanup of connector-generated logs. Connector logs (including webhook-related entries) are now cleaned up using a dedicated Odoo cleanup mechanism with a configurable retention period, helping reduce database noise and improve long-term performance.
    - [FIX] Other improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 1.19.2 (2025-12-13)
    - [IMP] Prepared connectors for Odoo 19.0 compatibility to ensure a smooth migration using special upgrade module. These changes align connector logic with Odoo 19.0's new e-commerce data models, making it easier and safer for customers to upgrade product categories and images during migration.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue with order status export where multiple rapid status changes could be ignored. The connector now creates a separate background job for each status update, ensuring all changes are exported in the correct sequence to the e-commerce store.

* 1.19.1 (2025-11-27)
    - [NEW] Added option to leave the Salesperson field empty on imported Sales Orders. Previously, orders were assigned to Administrator by default. This behavior now matches Odoo's website_sale flow and provides more flexibility for teams that prefer assigning Salespersons manually.
    - [IMP] The "Import Orders" setting is now preserved when Sale Integration is disabled, ensuring the selected value is restored when reactivated. Internal automation checks were also refined for more consistent behavior.
    - [FIX] Fixed an issue in the configuration validation wizard that caused validation to fail when using the Integration Queue Job module (VentorTech fork of Job Queue). The wizard now works correctly with the updated job management logic in Odoo 19.0.
    - [FIX] Order webhooks now correctly respect the "Orders Cut-off Date" setting. Orders created before the cut-off date will no longer be imported or updated when webhook events are received.
    - [FIX] Improved contact matching logic and resolved several edge-case issues that could create duplicate contacts in specific scenarios. Synchronization is now more accurate and consistent.
    - [FIX] Numerous background improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 1.19.0 (2025-10-27)
    - [NEW] Redesigned Import Wizard that unifies and simplifies all data import processes. Whether performing an initial setup or importing new records later, users can now follow a clear, step-by-step workflow to bring products, customers, and orders from their e-commerce store into Odoo with ease. This overhaul makes the entire import process faster, more reliable, and beginner-friendly.
    - [NEW] Added “Failed Job Notifications” checkbox on user profiles to control who receives alerts about failed jobs. Enabled by default for users with Job Queue Manager rights.
    - [IMP] Redesigned UI/UX for a smoother, more intuitive experience. Views and menus were reorganized for faster navigation, with new actions, clearer tooltips, and many small visual improvements.
    - [IMP] Improved webhook stability and data accuracy across all connectors. Fixed issues that could cause missing product details and enhanced order webhook logic to respect importable order statuses — preventing unwanted imports of orders in undesired states.
    - [IMP] Improved handling of external fulfillments and payments from e-commerce stores. These records are now applied not only during automated workflows but also when users perform actions manually — such as confirming orders or creating invoices in Odoo. This change provides greater flexibility and ensures external data stays synchronized regardless of how the workflow is triggered.
    - [IMP] Enhanced contact matching logic to prevent duplicates. The connector now uses normalized email and phone values when searching for existing Odoo contacts and addresses, significantly reducing the creation of duplicate records during synchronization.
    - [IMP] Status menu visibility is now limited to users with connector configuration access, keeping the interface clean and focused for regular users.
    - [FIX] Resolved issues with BoM quantity calculations for products using Bills of Materials. The connector now correctly computes stock levels in complex BoM scenarios, ensuring accurate quantity synchronization based on customer feedback.
    - [FIX] Updated sales dashboard analytics to exclude cancelled orders from statistics, ensuring more accurate sales and performance insights.
    - [FIX] Numerous background improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 1.18.2 (2025-07-23)
    - [IMP] Improved order webhook handling: the connector now checks for missing orders and triggers import if needed before processing status updates.
    - [FIX] Resolved issue where delivery notes were not added to PICK transfers in 2-step delivery operations.
    - [FIX] Resolved issue with Invoices API where credit notes and some invoices were not returned when requested by the e-commerce system.
    - [FIX] Over 30 background improvements and fixes implemented to boost overall performance, stability, and reliability.

* 1.18.1 (2025-05-27)
    - [NEW] Added advanced attribute mapping: Now it is possible to map values from external order JSON (e.g. order.store_name) to custom fields on Sales Orders and Deliveries. Includes support for optional Python transformations. Configuration is available in debug mode under Sales Orders → Order & Delivery Attribute Import Mapping.
    - [IMP] Refactored all error and warning messages to provide clearer explanations, actionable steps, and configuration guidance. Users can now troubleshoot common issues independently without needing to contact support.
    - [IMP] Improved: updated priority logic for background jobs (How the Connector Prioritizes Background Jobs).
    - [IMP] Improved consistency: all scheduled actions and webhooks are now executed under the OdooBot user.
    - [IMP] Added new Receive webhook gap (sec) setting to delay webhook event processing when needed.
    - [IMP] Added shortcut to external order on Sales Order form.
    - [FIX] Fixed: webhooks now respect product and order import filters set in the connection configuration.
    - [FIX] Fixed issue where product images could be deleted in Odoo when webhooks were active.
    - [FIX] Fixed issues with default customer configuration when customer data is missing.
    - [FIX] Fixed edge cases where customer info was incomplete or missing in imported orders.
    - [FIX] Made several small improvements to enhance overall performance and stability.

* 1.18.0 (2025-03-26)
    - [NEW] Launched a dynamic sales dashboard that displays key metrics - total sales, order trends, top products, and customer insights (new vs. returning and country stats) - in an intuitive, easy-to-understand format.
    - [NEW] Added "Ignore BoMs for Product Export" checkbox to skip export of components for products with attached Bill of Materials, useful for synchronizing products as simple items without bundles/kits.
    - [NEW] Added support for synchronizing stock levels for products with "Manufacture" BoMs based on component quantities and BOM records; can be enabled via the "Calculate Stock for 'Manufacture' BoMs" checkbox in the Inventory tab.
    - [NEW] Added support for formulas in pricelist items for both regular and sale price synchronization using Odoo pricelists, enabling export of formula-based prices to e-commerce stores.
    - [NEW] Added Getting Started wizard with introduction videos to enhance user experience.
    - [NEW] Added ability to specify default values for "Tag Group", "Account", and "Tax Scope" fields when creating new Odoo taxes via the connector.
    - [NEW] Added automatic tests for orders import and auto-workflow features in connector.
    - [IMP] Refactored image synchronization logic to use mappings, improving performance and preventing unnecessary deletion and creation of images.
    - [IMP] Improved contact creation logic by preventing duplicate child address contacts when billing and shipping addresses are identical, writing the address directly on the customer/company contact.
    - [IMP] Added button in debug mode to open product variant from the product templates view for templates with a single product variant.
    - [IMP] Improved customer matching during order creation by performing case-insensitive comparisons for name and surname fields to avoid duplicates (previously applied only for addresses).

    - NEW! Added the option to ignore VAT validation when saving customer information to Odoo (Customers → Ignore VAT validation).
    - NEW! Added the option to disable order total difference correction during order import. This prevents the addition of price difference lines when the order total doesn't match between your e-commerce store and Odoo (Sales Order → Order Total Difference Correction).
    - NEW! Added the option to disable order imports entirely from your e-commerce system to Odoo (Automation Jobs → Enable Order Import).
    - NEW! Introduced the ability to customize customer search during import. The "Search Customer Fields" setting (Testing tab) allows you to specify which fields are used to match customers. (Caution: Incorrect settings could lead to duplicate customers or mismatched orders.)
    - Fixed an issue with applying fiscal positions to imported orders.
    - Resolved a VAT validation problem for non-EU countries.
    - Corrected an error ("You cannot create recursive Partner hierarchies") that occurred in certain scenarios.

    - NEW! For B2B customers with a manageable number of clients, we've added the ability to manually map customers between your e-commerce system and Odoo. This provides you with additional control.
    - NEW! You now have the option to designate a specific product as a placeholder for order lines with removed products or custom items, ensuring smoother order processing.
    - NEW! You now have the option to switch between different discount application methods. Choose to add discounts as separate order lines (default), or apply them directly to product lines using the 'Discount' field. This can be set from the 'Add discounts as a separate order line' setting on your integration settings.
    - NEW! We've introduced a new post-installation wizard that automatically guides you through the steps needed to ensure your Odoo setup is optimized for our connector. This will help you get up and running quickly and smoothly.
    - We've added a new feature for developers to customize how products are linked between your e-commerce system and Odoo. This allows you to use specific fields other than the default SKU or Barcode for product synchronization. Important Note: This feature is intended for developers with a technical understanding of Odoo and your e-commerce platform.
    - We've fixed an issue that was preventing product quantities from updating correctly on your e-commerce store when changes were made in the Ventor application.
    - We've resolved an issue where product internal references in Odoo were still being updated after disabling import in the mapping table.
    - We've enhanced how our connector imports categories from your e-commerce store, especially when multiple categories share the same name. This resolves previous errors and ensures more accurate category matching in Odoo.
    - We've resolved a dependency issue in Odoo 17.0 that caused a “TypeError: Model 'product.image' does not exist in registry.” error. Our connector is now fully compatible with the latest Odoo version.
    - We've resolved an issue that prevented updating already mapped products with archived or draft variants. Your product data will now synchronize smoothly from your e-commerce system.
    - We've also made several additional fixes and enhancements for a better overall experience.

Available only in Debug mode on the “Product Defaults“ tab.
    - Improved logic for inventory initial import.
    - Now field with the integrations list is also tracked for changes, so changing it will trigger product export.
    - Do not send inactive product variants when exporting product to E-Commerce Systems.
    - Download orders by batches to avoid timeout of “Receive Orders” job.
    - Added to sales integration list of global fields that are monitored for changes. So when the product is updated and these fields are changed, then we also trigger the export of the product.
    - Product attributes are synchronized according to their sequence to preserve the same order as in Odoo.
    - Added basic automated tests for the Integration module.
    - Other small improvements and fixes.

    - Copy “E-Commerce Payment Method” from Sales Order to the related Customer Invoice
    - Sales Orders with a non-valid EU VAT number will be created. But a warning message will be added in Internal Note for the created Sales Order informing the user about this problem
    - Convert weight on import/export of products in case UoM in Odoo is different from UoM in E-Commerce System (kgs vs lbs).
    - Other small fixes and improvements.

* 1.10.0 (2023-02-17)
    - NEW! Reworked product import and export mechanism to allow flexible configuration of product fields that are downloaded from external system to Odoo and that are exported from Odoo to external system.
    - NEW! Trigger products export only if fields that are marked with “Send field for updating“ are updated.
